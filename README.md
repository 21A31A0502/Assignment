Problem Statement 
We aim to develop a web-based WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor using 
Next.js that allows users to visually mix and match different clothing items by dragging and 
dropping individual clothing icons into a virtual canvas. The goal is to enable users to see 
how different clothing combinations look together in real time. 
Key features include: 
1. Drag-and-Drop Interface: Users can drag individual clothing item icons (provided as 
assets) onto a virtual model or canvas to create outfit combinations. 
2. Visual Outfit Assembly: The editor will allow users to layer and position clothing 
items to visualize full outfits. 
3. Selection and Cart Integration: Once a user is satisfied with a clothing combination, 
they can select that outfit and add it to a shopping cart for purchase. 
4. Next.js Framework: The application will be built using Next.js to ensure high 
performance, server-side rendering, and scalability. 
The solution should provide a smooth, interactive, and intuitive user experience to help 
customers confidently put together and purchase complete outfit combinations online. 
A sample virtual canvas is provided below for reference – a new one needs to be developed 
which is user intuitive. The icons to be used are provided in the attached zip file.  
Expected output : 
A fully functional Next.js project implementing the outfit builder with: 
• A drag-and-drop interface 
• Clothing icons 
• Canvas to compose outfits 
• "Add to cart" button logic 
A README.md file that explains: 
• How to install dependencies 
• How to run the app locally 
• Features of the app 
• Any additional instructions
